## Abstract

*Given the prevalence of 3D medical imaging technologies such as MRI and CT that are widely used in diagnosing and treating diverse diseases, 3D segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks of medical image analysis. Recently, Transformer-based models have started to achieve state-of-the-art performances across many vision tasks, through pre-training on large-scale natural image benchmark datasets. While works on medical image analysis have also begun to explore Transformer-based models, there is currently no optimal strategy to effectively leverage pre-trained Transformers, primarily due to the difference in dimensionality between 2D natural images and 3D medical images. Existing solutions either split 3D images into 2D slices and predict each slice independently, thereby losing crucial depth-wise information, or modify the Transformer architecture to support 3D inputs without leveraging pre-trained weights. In this work, we use a simple yet effective weight inflation strategy to adapt pre-trained Transformers from 2D to 3D, retaining the benefit of both transfer learning and depth information. We further investigate the effectiveness of transfer from different pre-training sources and objectives. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances across a broad range of 3D medical image datasets, and can become a standard strategy easily utilized by all work on Transformer-based models for 3D medical images, to maximize performance.*

## Approach

![](./docs/figures/approach.png)
**Figure: Approach overview. Large-scale pre-trained Transformers are used as the encoder in the segmentation model for transfer learning, in which weights are adapted using the inflation strategy to support 3D inputs. Each 3D image is split into windows, which contain a small number of neighbor slices. Each window is fed into the segmentation model and the segmentation of the center slice is predicted. All the predicted slices are aggregated to form the final 3D prediction.**

## Getting Started

### Installation

Please install dependencies by

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
or 
```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```
### Dataset and Model

- We use the **[BCV](https://www.synapse.org/\#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789)**, **[ACDC](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/)**, **[MSD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzeNU1EKnK81PyTsrx0ujfNl-t0Jo8uE/view?usp=sharing)** dataset, please register and download these datasets.
- Decompress each dataset and move it to the corresponding the `src/data/` folder (e.g., move **BCV** to `src/data/bcv/`)
- Run the pre-processing script *split_data_to_slices_nii.py* in each folder to generate processed data. (e.g., **BCV** will be processed to `src/data/bcv/processed/`).
- Run the weight downloading script *download_weights.sh* in the `src/backbones/encoders/pretrained_models/`folder.

### Training

1. To train the best segmentation model with both transfer learning and depth information (i.e., **Ours** in the paper), run:

```bash
cd src/
bash scripts/train_[dataset].sh
```

All the hardward requirements for training such as number of GPUs, CPUs, RAMs are listed in each script.

To change the different encoder, set `--encoder swint/videoswint/dino`.

To use your own dataset, modify `--data_dir`

To adjust the number of training steps, modify `--max_steps`.

2. To train the segmentation model with only transfer learning and without depth information (i.e., **Ours w/o D** in the paper), simply add `--force_2d 1` and run:

```bash
cd src/
# add `--force_2d 1` at the end of the script
bash scripts/train_[dataset].sh
```

3. To train the segmentation model without transfer learning or depth information (i.e., **Ours w/o T&D** in the paper), simply add `--use_pretrained 0` and run:

```bash
cd src/
# add both `--force_2d 1` and `--use_pretrained 0` at the end of the script
bash scripts/train_[dataset].sh
```

Results are displayed at the end of training and can also be found at `wandb/` (open with `wandb` web or local client).

Model files are saved in `MedicalSegmentation/` folder. 

4. To reproduce UNETR baseline, follow the tutorial of the **official UNETR release** and set the correct training and validation set:

```
https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/master/3d_segmentation/unetr_btcv_segmentation_3d_lightning.ipynb
```

Will clean and integrate UNETR codes in the final code release.

### Evaluation

To evaluate any trained segmentation model, simply add `--evaluation 1` and `--model_path <path/to/checkpoint>` and run:

```bash
cd src/
# add `--evaluation 1` and `--model_path <path/to/checkpoint>` at the end of the script
bash scripts/train_[dataset].sh
```

Results are displayed at the end of evaluation and can also be found at `wandb/` (open with `wandb` web or local client).

The predictions are saved in `dumps/` (open with `pickle.Unpickler`) .

### Compute FLOPS

To compute the FLOPS of the vanilla Transformer and inflated Transformer, simply run:

```bash
cd src/
python compute_flops.py
```

Should get `2D FLOPS: 213343401984` and `3D FLOPS: 214954014720`, which indicates there is little increased computational cost of our method.
